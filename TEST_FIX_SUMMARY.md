# Test Fix Summary âœ…

## Issue Fixed
The CI/CD pipeline test was failing because of a mismatch between expected and actual Flask behavior when handling invalid JSON.

## Root Cause
When Flask receives invalid JSON in a request, `request.get_json()` raises a `BadRequest` exception (HTTP 400), but our original exception handler was catching it as a generic exception and returning HTTP 500.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `app.py`
- Added import for `BadRequest` from `werkzeug.exceptions`
- Added specific exception handling for `BadRequest` to return HTTP 400
- Maintained existing `json.JSONDecodeError` handling for completeness

### 2. Updated `tests/test_api.py`
- Fixed the test expectation to match the corrected behavior
- Now expects `"Invalid JSON format"` error message for invalid JSON

## Test Results
```
âœ… All 14 tests now pass
âœ… 76% code coverage achieved
âœ… Pipeline ready for GitLab CI/CD
```

## What This Means
- **Pipeline will now pass** âœ…
- **Proper error handling** for all JSON scenarios
- **Consistent HTTP status codes** (400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors)
- **Production-ready error responses**

## Ready to Push! ðŸš€
The pipeline is now fully functional and all tests pass. You can safely push to master/main.
